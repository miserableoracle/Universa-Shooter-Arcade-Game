# Universa-Shooter-Arcade-Game
# A Galaga Clone. Remaking The Classic.

### Universa is a clone of Galaga shooter arcade game. It was developed as a part of milestone project of second semester. This was a group project. Universa was developed using SDL and encompassing entity-component system. Each enemy entity had pathfollowing algorithm applied to them to make them spawn off screen and bring them to their position, flying in a formation. 

### The game has 4 levels, first two levels included basic enemies (which can be destroyed with one hit), third and fourth levels involved rather difficult enemies which had hit points of 3 to 5. The final level is a boss level where a giant spaceship covers one third of the screen and tries to destroy player's ship. 

### Universa also supported item drops
* Shield (One hit protection)
* Multishots (Shooting 3 bullets at once)(Limited to 10 shots in one powerup)
* Laser (Shooting a giant laser, obliterating anything that comes in its way)

### And a little cheatcode... :D
* Unlimited life and a new space ship skin
